# price_up

A single page web application to help sole traders price their products according to costs, time and desired rate of markup.


## Try It

A working version of the site can be found at http://price-up.herokuapp.com.

1) To get the wholesale price of a product, enter the 'cost of materials' in the first box and the 'time spent in minutes' to produce it in the second.

'Rate per minute' and 'wholesale markup' are respectively set to defaults of Â£0.34 and x2, but can be easily changed in the boxes provided.

Click 'Calculate wholesale' button to return the resulting price.


2) Likewise to get the retail price of an item, enter its previously established wholesale price, followed by your chosen rate of 'retail price markup' (set by default to x2.5).

Click 'Calculate RRP' to return the retail price.
